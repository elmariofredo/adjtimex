Subject: FTCBFS: uses the build architecture compiler

adjtimex fails to cross build from source, because its Makefile fails to
use the compiler discovered by ./configure. Instead it uses the make
default "cc". After adding the CC=@CC@ substitution to Makefile.in,
adjtimex cross build successfully. Please consider applying the attached
patch.

Closes: #882577
