_Description: Should adjtimex be run at installation and at every startup?
 adjtimex can run at system startup to set the kernel time parameters to
 the values in /etc/default/adjtimex. Don't accept if you just want to
 use adjtimex to inspect the current parameters.

_Description: Should adjtimexconfig be run at installation time?
 The adjtimexconfig script will use adjtimex to find values for the kernel
 variables tick and frequency that will make the system clock approximately
 agree with the hardware clock (also known as the CMOS clock).  It then
 saves these values in the configuration file /etc/default/adjtimex so the
 settings will be restored on every boot, when /etc/init.d/adjtimex runs.
 .
 The script takes 70 sec to run. Alternatively, you can run adjtimexconfig
 yourself at a later time, or determine the kernel variables one of several
 other ways (see the adjtimex man page) and install them in
 /etc/default/adjtimex.
