Template: adjtimex/run_daemon
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Should adjtimex be run at installation and at every startup?
 Running adjtimex at system startup will set the kernel time parameters to
 the values in /etc/default/adjtimex.
 .
 You should not choose this option if you just want to
 use adjtimex to inspect the current parameters.

# Translators: do not translate "tick" and "frequency"
_Description: Run adjtimexconfig when adjtimex is installed or upgraded?
 The adjtimexconfig script will use adjtimex to find values for the kernel
 variables "tick" and "frequency" that will make the system clock approximately
 agree with the hardware clock (also known as the CMOS clock).  It then
 saves these values in the configuration file /etc/default/adjtimex so the
 settings will be restored on every boot, when /etc/init.d/adjtimex runs.
 .
 The script takes 70 seconds to run, so running it for every upgrade
 may be a waste of time. Alternatively, you can run adjtimexconfig
 manually when needed, or determine the kernel variables by using other
 methods and set them manually in /etc/default/adjtimex.
