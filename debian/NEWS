adjtimex (1.29-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  adjtimexconfig will not be called on every install/upgrade by default,
  so as to avoid 70 seconds waiting time, except you choose so in debconf.
  If you installed adjtimex previously, and are using previously default "Yes",
  now you can change to "No" by command:
    dpkg-reconfigure adjtimex
  then choose "No" in debconf.

  Because adjtimexconfig is not triggered by default on install/upgrade,
  so there's no /etc/default/adjtimex by default now, the startup service
  is skipped accordingly, until /etc/default/adjtimex is ready.  So you can
  simply run adjtimexconfig to let it generate for you.
