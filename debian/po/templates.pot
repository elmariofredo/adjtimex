"The adjtimexconfig script will use adjtimex to find values for the kernel "
"variables tick and frequency that will make the system clock approximately "
"agree with the hardware clock (also known as the CMOS clock).  It then saves "
"these values in the configuration file /etc/default/adjtimex so the settings "
"will be restored on every boot, when /etc/init.d/adjtimex runs."

"The script takes 70 sec to run. Alternatively, you can run adjtimexconfig "
