#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"The adjtimexconfig script will use adjtimex to find values for the kernel "
"variables tick and frequency that will make the system clock approximately "
"agree with the hardware clock (also known as the CMOS clock).  It then saves "
"these values in the configuration file /etc/default/adjtimex so the settings "
