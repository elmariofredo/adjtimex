Description: Utility to display or set the kernel time variables
 This program gives you raw access to the kernel time variables.  For
 a machine connected to the Internet, or equipped with a precision
 oscillator or radio clock, the best way to keep the system clock
 correct is with xntpd.  For a standalone or intermittently connected
 machine, you may use adjtimex instead to at least correct for
 systematic drift.  adjtimex can optionally adjust the system clock
 using the CMOS clock as a reference.
