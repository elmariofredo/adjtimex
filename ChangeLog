2006-05-27  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (log_times): Permit ntpdate to contact any number of
	time servers.
	(log_times): add -q to ntpdate command line
	(puthackent): with --verbose, display log entry and path to log
	file.
	(valid_system_rate, valid_cmos_rate): in messages, ask about
	/sbin/hwclock rather than the old /sbin/clock.
	(probe_time): If call to adjtimex fails, quit with error message.
	(Need root priv.)  Thus, "adjtimex -r" and "adjtimex -c" fail
	rather than succeeding with bogus results.

2006-05-26  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (log_times): use stat to look for ntpdate in
	/usr/bin, /bin, /usr/sbin and /sbin. Close pipe with pclose
	instead of fclose.

	* adjtimex.8: express PLL time constant in terms of a power of two
	rather than the more obscure 1<<val.

2006-05-25  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (log_times): Eliminate compare_cmos_sys(), call
	cmos_read_time() instead.

2006-05-24  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (review): For both CMOS and system clocks, write
	suggested and current adjustments on a separate line from the
	estimated error in ppm.
	(cmos_read_time): Move the sanity check code (to adjust CMOS time
	by multiples of one hour) and code to read sytem time into this
	function.

2006-05-23  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (compare_cmos_sys): delete code to find UTC time via
	switching TZ (was controlled by ZONESWITCH, which was not #defined).

	* adjtimex.8: -h specifies the host, so it can't also ask for the
	help printout.  -V or --verbose increases verbosity.  Shifting
	CMOS time by up to 13 hours.

2006-05-23  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* adjtimex.c (cmos_read_time): set tm_isdst to -1 to signal that
	summer time information is not available (/dev/rtc doesn't set it)

2006-05-22  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* adjtimex.c (cmos_read_time): adjust month, day of week, and year
	only if reading from /dev/port.

	* Makefile (VERSION): version 1.21

	* adjtimex.c (compare): Adjust CMOS times by + or - 60 min, if
	that brings them closer to the system time.  If they still differ
	by more than 6 min, then print a warning and suppress logging.
	(Thanks to Alain Guibert <derogaton at oreka.com> for noting that
	summer time start/end can impact the log.)

2006-05-21  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* ChangeLog: Fix spelling of name Alain Guibert (sorry :-)

	* adjtimex.c (cmos_read_time): use /dev/rtc interface if possible
	(thanks to  Richard Henderson <rth at twiddle.net>).

2004-09-19  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.20

	* adjtimex.c (compare): in "compare" or "adjust", return
	immediately after printing last result (instead of sleeping an
	extra $interval seconds) (Thanks to Alain Guibert <derogaton at
	oreka.com>)

2004-09-11  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.19

	* adjtimex.c (compare): Account for the current frequency value
	when calculating the recommended frequency value.  Simplify
	calculation of recommended tick.
	(compare): print estimated system clock error in ppm instead of
	obscure "second diff".

	* adjtimex.8: use 2^16 instead of the more obscure 1<<16.

	* adjtimex.c: revert to poll-wait instead of using /dev/rtc,
	because the latter only provides time with one second precision.

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.18

	* Makefile.in (install): create manual directory if necessary

	to Alain Guibert <derogaton at oreka.com>)

2004-04-09  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* adjtimex.c (longopt): --status switch sets clock status

	(cmos_init): use /dev/rtc when available (thanks to Richard

2003-05-31  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	message, and add explicit ones.  (gcc 3.3 complains otherwise)

2003-04-30  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.15

	* adjtimex.c: for ia64, call adjtimex instead of using syscall

2003-04-27  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* adjtimex.8: Compare the roles of ntpd, hwclock, and adjtimex.

	Mahajan <sanjoy at mrao.cam.ac.uk>

2002-01-06  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* adjtimex.c: #define _GNU_SOURCE so strptime is available
	* (log_times): use popen() to recover output from ntpdate, instead
	of an unsafe temporary file (thanks to Colin Phipps <crp22 at
	cam.ac.uk>) 

2000-01-03  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.9

	* adjtimex.c (usage): remove invalid entries -? and -h

	number of adjtimex.c)

1998-11-28  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>
